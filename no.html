  <textarea type="align-center"> Oh, well i hope that it won't change anything between us. You're really one of the best people that i ever met, and that's why i kinda hesitated to send you this 'cause i didn't want to ruin our friendship. But it's okay! ^o^
 I'm aware that even if we tried it won't be the same as before, i don't know maybe it'll be awkward for you which i completely understand.
If you wish to stop talking to me or maybe less i understand.
(ps: i wrote that wayyy before so now u don't have a choice you're mine🥰)</textarea>
